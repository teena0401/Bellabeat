# Bellabeat

###Introduction 
This case study is the final project in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In the case study, I’ll be analyzing a public dataset provided by the course as if I were working with the Marketing and Product departments as a data analyst at the health and wellness company Bellabeat.

####About Bellabeat 
Bellabeat is a wellness company based in San Francisco, California that develops smart technology for women. Their mission is to empower women by providing them with the data to discover themselves.

Bellabeat products are available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website.

##### Scenario 
Bellabeat is a successful small company with the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I’ve been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices, which will then be used to guide marketing strategy for the company.

#### Business Task 
Analyze smart device user data to gain insight into how consumers are using their non-Bellabeat smart devices (in this case, FitBit), and apply these insights to comparable Bellabeat products such as the Bellabeat Leaf.

### About the Data 

The dataset for this case study, FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, was provided by Google through the data science website Kaggle. The dataset was originally generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey spanned a 30-day period starting April 12th, 2016 to May 12th, 2016.

The three tables I analyzed from this dataset are dailyActivity_merged, sleepDay_merged, and weightLogInfo_merged, renamed DailyActivity, SleepLog, and WeightLog, respectively.

####Limitations

Most likely, the data isn’t representative of all FitBit users. Only 33 people took part in the survey. The largest table in the dataset, ‘dailyActivity_merged’, for example, contains 15 columns—almost half as many attributes as participants.
Roughly a quarter of the participants didn’t record any sleep data. Three quarters of participants didn’t record weight data.
The data is old. Both FitBit and Bellabeat have come out with new products and features since 2016. Smart device usage, like the devices themselves, has likely changed since then.
The data comes from a third-party source with no way to examine credibility or potential biases.
Participants weren’t asked to wear/use their FitBits for the entirety of the 30-day period, so some records are missing.
